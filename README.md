This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error that occurs when implicitly converting an array to a string. The `greeter` function expects a string argument, but an array is passed. TypeScript's type system prevents this implicit conversion, resulting in a compilation error. The solution involves explicitly converting the array to a string using the `join()` method or using type assertion.  This example showcases the importance of type safety in TypeScript and demonstrates a clear solution for this kind of error.
